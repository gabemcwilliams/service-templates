## 🔍 RedisInsight Service Overview

RedisInsight is a GUI for Redis. That’s it. It looks pretty and helps you not completely destroy your Redis data by
accident. Great for local dev, demos, or pretending to be a DBA.

### 🛠 How to Use It

1. Start the container (`docker-compose up -d`, obviously).
2. Open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:5540](http://localhost:5540)
3. Connect it to your Redis instance at `10.0.80.2:6379` (or whatever your Redis is actually doing).
4. Click things. Visualize. Pretend you're debugging.

---

### 🛑 Warnings

- **Not secured.** No password, no auth, just vibes. Don’t expose this thing to the outside world unless you like risk.
- It stores configs and insights in `/data`, which is persisted via the `redis-insight` volume.

---

### 💡 Pro Tips

- Great for visualizing keys, TTLs, memory usage, and debugging weirdness.
- Pair this with a local Redis running in the same network (`10.0.80.2`) for clean integration.
- If RedisInsight can't connect, it’s probably your firewall, Docker network misconfig, or because you left the Redis
  container in a coma.
